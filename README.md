# TERCO-Temperature-Regulating-Clothing
### By Eugene Choe and Jihoon Han

Temperature regulating clothing, or TERCO, is an energy harvesting smart clothing aimed to help people experience temperature regulation while outside. We initially wanted to design an energy efficient wearable system that provides heating and cooling for outdoor activities, for a lot of people expereince temperature issues due to lack of heating and cooling system outside. Thus, we wanted create a smart clothing that provides temperature control system for both heating and cooling. However, the issue with conventional temperature control system is that it consumes a lot of energy and creates wastes, so we wanted to design a nearly self-sustaining system that does not require frequent changes of batteries.
